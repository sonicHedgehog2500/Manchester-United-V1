										Manchester United's home fixtures began within a capacity of 50,000 prior to planning a 
										new stadium with doubled capacity near Trafford Park Industrial State. Architect, 
										Archibald Leitch designed the new stadium which officially opened in 1910. Unfortunately, 
										Manchester United suffered a 4-3 defeat to Liverpool in the first game at this new stadium. 
										In addition, Old Trafford's capacity was reduced from 100,000 to 80,000 as a way for the 
										club to save money. An FA Cup semi-final between Wolves & Grimbsy Town saw Old Trafford 
										achieve its highest attendance record with 76,962. During WW2, Old Trafford suffered 
										significant damage from German air raids and unable to host any matches until being 
										repaired. The repairs were affected due to delays in limited post-war resources and had 
										been completed after 8 long years. Upon completion in 1949, Manchester United returned to 
										Old Trafford with improvements and expansions made to restoring the United Road (North) 
										Stand. Thereafter, Old Trafford became a revenue in the World Cup during 1966 and hosted 
										3 group stage matches. This time period saw Old Trafford's capacity to vary around 60,000. 
										Although, the stadium demonstrated improvements between the 1970s and 1980s with new, 
										improved covers, more seating arrangements and improved executive facilities with the 
										exception of hooliganism requiring fences to separate stands from the pitch. In relation, 
										1990 saw plans in place to convert Old Trafford into an all-seater meaning Stretford End 
										terraces and lower tier seats would be destroyed prior to having new replacements. In 
										2006, newly built stands in the North Stands upper-tier corners saw Old Trafford reach 
										its current maximum capacity. Also, the North Stand had been renamed as “Sir Alex 
										Ferguson Stand” honoring Manchester United's long-time manager in 2011.

									<p>
										Manchester United sponsored by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, were 
										a limited company selling shares to their supporters in 1982. Following this, 
										ownership of the club had been passed onto 4 businessmen who spent £500 to prevent 
										Manchester United from becoming bankrupt. Unfortunately, this was inevitable as 
										Manchester United became bankrupt following the death of John Henry Davies in 1927. 
										During December 1931, a £2000 investment was made by James W. Gibson saving the club 
										from bankruptcy. In addition, Gibson's son, Alan contributed to this club following 
										promotion onto the Manchester United Board in 1948. 3 years later, Alan passed away 
										leading to the Glazer family keeping possession of Manchester United courtesy of 
										Gibson's wife Lillian. Furthermore, Harold Hardman, a former Manchester United player 
										was appointed Chairman while Louis Edwards gained promotion to the Board following the 
										Munich Disaster. Upon her death in January 1971, Lillian's shares were passed onto Alan 
										Gibson who during 1978, sold a percentage of these shares to Martin Edwards. Similarly, 
										Edwards became Chairman upon the death of his father in 1980. In 1984, media proprietor 
										Robert Maxwell looked to purchase ownership of Manchester United. However, Maxwell failed 
										to meet Edwards' purchase price. In relation, Edwards tried selling the club to Micheal 
										Knighton for £20 million. Even though this deal collapsed, Knighton became a Board Of 
										Directors in 1989. At one time in 1971, the club raised £6.7 million in their stock market 
										prior to involvement in a takeover bid during 1998 from Sky UK. In April 1999, a £623 
										million offer for a takeover was accepted by the Board prior to being blocked by the 
										Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Several years later, John Magnier, J.P. McManus and Sir 
										Alex Ferguson became club shareholders and a struggle occurred among these 3 individuals. 
										Both Magnier and McManus aimed to remove Ferguson from his role as Manchester United manager. 
										In May 2005, Malcom Glazer bought 28.7% of the stake belonging to both Magnier and McManus 
										ahead of gaining an interest courtesy of his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd during a 
										takeover valued at about £800 million. Finalisation of this purchase led to Manchester United 
										being removed from the stock market exchange. As a result, the club confirmed a £660 million 
										debt refinancing package. Thus, leading towards a 30% decrease in yearly interest payments to 
										£62 million per year during July 2006. By January 2010, Manchester United were £716.5 million 
										in debt and refinanced using a bond issue value at £504 million allowing £509 million to be 
										paid off.

										A 1958 European Cup tie featured Manchester United travelling to Yugoslavia in a fixture 
										against Red Star Belgrade. The Manchester United squad along with other individuals boarded 
										a flight returning to the UK on 6th February 1958. The flight landed in Munich to refuel. 
										Unfortunately, the aeroplane encountered engine problems resulting in aborting 2 departures. 
										But, a third departure was the aeroplane's chance to take off. However, the runway was covered 
										with snow resulting in the aeroplane colliding into a fence then a house. As a result, the 
										following passengers lost their lives:
									</p>

										<ul>
											<li>Roger Bryne.</li>
											<li>Eddie Colman.</li>
